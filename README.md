# Descrete-Mathematic

This is my discrete mathematics projects:

# 1.Propositions:
This code consist of some logical operators like: And - Or - if - if and only if and ... implemented with operator overloading in c++.

r-->s
p-->r
p^~q
:: ~s

# 2. Closure:
This code gives any square matrix and calculate its following closures:  
1.Reflective closure  
2.Symmetric closure  
3.Transive closure
