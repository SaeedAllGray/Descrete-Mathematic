These are my discrete mathematics projects:

# 1.Deduction:
In mathematical logic, a deduction theorem is a metatheorem that justifies doing conditional proofs — to prove an implication A → B, assume A as an hypothesis and then proceed to derive B — in systems that do not have an explicit inference rule for this. Deduction theorems exist for both propositional logic and first-order logic.[1] The deduction theorem is an important tool in Hilbert-style deduction systems because it permits one to write more comprehensible and usually much shorter proofs than would be possible without it. In certain other formal proof systems the same conveniency is provided by an explicit inference rule;
This code consist of some logical operators like: And - Or - if - if and only if and ... implemented with operator overloading in c++.

# 2. Closure:
This code gives any square matrix and calculate its following closures:  
1.Reflective closure  
2.Symmetric closure  
3.Transive closure
