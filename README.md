# Descrete-Mathematic

These are my discrete mathematics projects:

# 1.Conclusion:
Mathematical logic is often used for logical proofs. Proofs are valid arguments that determine the truth values of mathematical statements.
An argument is a sequence of statements. The last statement is the conclusion and all its preceding statements are called premises (or hypothesis). The symbol “∴
∴
”, (read therefore) is placed before the conclusion. A valid argument is one where the conclusion follows from the truth values of the premises.

Rules of Inference provide the templates or guidelines for constructing valid arguments from the statements that we already have.
This code consist of some logical operators like: And - Or - if - if and only if and ... implemented with operator overloading in c++.

r-->s
p-->r
p^~q
:: ~s

# 2. Closure:
This code gives any square matrix and calculate its following closures:  
1.Reflective closure  
2.Symmetric closure  
3.Transitive closure
